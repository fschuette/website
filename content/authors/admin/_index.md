I am interested in the question of how language is deeply intertwined with other aspects of human cognition. This question goes in both directions: How do other phenomena, like verbal memory, inherently rely on linguistic representations? At the same time: How do language comprehension and production rely upon on and exploit other cognitive processes, such as attention and executive control?
