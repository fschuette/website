The P600 component of the event-related potential (ERP) is typically observed upon grammaticality violations, reversal anomalies, and syntactic ambiguities when
  reading or listening to sentences. It is often interpreted as a signal of specific linguistic syntactic and combinatorial operations and continues to inform
  neurocognitive models of language comprehension. However, its underlying process is still not agreed upon. 
  
  My PhD project aims to contribute to the current debate about how much the cognitive process underlying the P600 is tied to cognitive control and whether it
  might be a variant of a more domain-general component (the P3) and thus not reflect a specific linguistic process per se. More specifically, my project
  further tests the hypothesis that – possibly just like the P3 – the P600 might reflect phasic norepinephrine release from the locus coeruleus (LC-NE) to
  motivationally significant stimuli more generally (Sassenhagen et al., 2014; Sassenhagen & Bornkessel-Schlesewsky, 2015; Sassenhagen & Fiebach, 2019). 
  To this end, I link EEG activity recorded during sentence processing tasks to reaction time and pupillary measures. In addition, one of my studies manipulates
  noradrenaline release non-invasively via transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation.
