summary: We investigated whether semantic content of music can assist novel word learning. Forty novel words and their German translation were visually
  presented with either semantically congruent or incongruent music. We found that performance was significantly better on the retention of novel words
  presented with semantically congruent music than those presented with semantically incongruent music. Our findings thus indicate that semantic
  “enrichment” by music can modulate novel word acquisition.
