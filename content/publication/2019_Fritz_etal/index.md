abstract: Musical excerpts have been shown to have the capacity to prime the processing of target words and vice versa, strongly suggesting that music can
  convey concepts. However, to date no study has investigated an influence of musical semantics on novel word acquisition, thus corroborating evidence for a
  similarity of underlying semantic processing of music and words behaviourally. The current study investigates whether semantic content of music can assist the
  acquisition of novel words. Forty novel words and their German translation were visually presented to 26 participants accompanied by either semantically
  congruent or incongruent music. Semantic congruence between music and words was expected to increase performance in the subsequent forced-choice recognition
  test. Participants performed significantly better on the retention of novel words presented with semantically congruent music compared to those presented with
  semantically incongruent music. This provides first evidence that semantic “enrichment” by music during novel word learning can augment novel word
  acquisition. This finding may lead to novel approaches in foreign language acquisition and language rehabilitation, and further strongly supports the concept
  that music has a strong capacity to iconically convey meaning.
