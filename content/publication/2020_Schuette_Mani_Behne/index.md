abstract: Young children learn selectively from others based on the speakers' prior accuracy. This indicates that they recognize the models’ (in)competence and 
  use it to predict who will provide the most accurate and useful information in the future. Here, we investigated whether 5-year-old children are also able to
  use speaker reliability retrospectively, once they have more information regarding their competence. They first experienced two previously unknown speakers
  who provided conflicting information about the referent of a novel label, with each speaker using the same novel label to refer exclusively to a different
  novel object. Following this, children learned about the speakers' differing labelling accuracy. Subsequently, children selectively endorsed the object–label
  link initially provided by the speaker who turned out to be reliable significantly above chance. Crucially, more than half of these children justified their
  object selection with reference to speaker reliability, indicating the ability to explicitly reason about their selective trust in others based on the
  informants’ individual competences. Findings further corroborate the notion that young children are able to use advanced, metacognitive strategies (trait
  reasoning) to learn selectively. By contrast, since learning preceded reliability exposure and gaze data showed no preferential looking toward the more
  reliable speaker, findings cannot be accounted for by attentional bias accounts of selective social learning.
