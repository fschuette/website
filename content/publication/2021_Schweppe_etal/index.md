abstract: In the classic view of verbal short-term memory, immediate recall is achieved by maintaining phonological representations, while
  the influence of other linguistic information is negligible. According to language-based accounts, short-term retention of verbal
  material is inherently bound to language production and comprehension, thus also influenced by semantic or syntactic factors. In
  line with this, serial recall is better when lists are presented in a canonical word order for English rather than in a noncanonical
  order (e.g., when adjectives precede nouns rather than vice versa, Perham et al., 2009, Quarterly Journal of Experimental
  Psychology, 62[7], 1285–1293). However, in many languages, grammaticality is not exclusively determined by word order.
  In German, an adjective–noun sequence is grammatical only if the adjective is inflected in congruence with the nouns person,
  number, and grammatical gender. Therefore, we investigated whether similar effects of syntactic word order occur in German. In
  two modified replications of Perham et al.'s study, we presented lists of three pairs of adjectives and nouns, presented in
  adjective–noun or in noun–adjective order. In addition, we manipulated morphosyntactic congruence between nouns and
  adjectives within pairs (Congruently inflected vs. uninflected adjectives in Exp. 1, Congruently inflected vs. incongruently
  inflected adjectives in Exp. 2). Both experiments show an interaction: Word order affected recall performance only when adjectives were
  inflected in congruence with the corresponding noun. These findings are in line with language-based models and indicate that, in
  a language that determines grammaticality in an interplay of syntactic and morphosyntactic factors, word order alone is not
  sufficient to improve verbal short-term memory.
